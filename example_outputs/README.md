# ViralQuest Pipeline: Output Examples
This document provides examples of HTML reports generated by the ViralQuest bioinformatics pipeline. Each example corresponds to a public dataset available from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA).

**Assembly parameters**

- Fastp was used in default mode to trimming and remove low quality reads, the version was `fastp v0.23.2`
- `MEGAHIT v1.2.9` was the assembly tool used in this libraries to generate the final fasta input
