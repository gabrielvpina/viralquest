ICTV	Family	Caulimoviridae	Family: Caulimoviridae -- Summary--Caulimoviridae is a family of non-enveloped reverse-transcribing plant viruses with non-covalently closed circular dsDNA genomes of 7.1���9.8 kbp that are encapsidated by viral coat proteins into isometric virions (members of the genera Caulimovirus, Cavemovirus, Petuvirus, Rosadnavirus, Solendovirus and Soymovirus) or bacilliform-shaped virions (members of the genera Badnavirus and Tungrovirus) (Table 1. Caulimoviridae). No data is currently available on the virion morphology for viruses in the genera Dioscovirus and Vaccinivirus. Members of the Caulimoviridae infect a wide range of monocot and dicot plants, although members of a single species have generally narrow host ranges. Some viruses of this family cause economically important diseases of tropical and subtropical crops. Insect vectors have been identified for badnaviruses, caulimoviruses and tungroviruses. Endogenous viral elements (EVEs; viral DNA integrated into the host nuclear genome) are known for badnaviruses, caulimoviruses, cavemoviruses, petuviruses and solendoviruses. Some caulimovirid EVEs in Musa balbisiana, Petunia hybrida and Nicotiana edwardsonii are replication competent and can lead to spontaneous infections by episomal forms of the viral genome through activation by biotic or abiotic stresses. However, the majority of caulimovirid EVEs, which are widespread in the genomes of vascular plants, are considered to be replication defective. --Table 1. Caulimoviridae.-Characteristics of members of the family Caulimoviridae-Characteristic
ICTV	Order	Tymovirales	Order: Tymovirales-Chapter Version: ICTV Ninth Report; 2009 Taxonomy Release-Introduction--The order Tymovirales contains viruses that mostly infect plants, have a single molecule of positive sense ssRNA and which are united by the similarities in their replication-associated polyproteins (which account for the majority of the coding capacity of the genome). While there are differences in particle morphology between families, phylogenetic analysis requires the family Tymoviridae (with isometric virions) to be included within a ���flexivirus��� grouping of viruses that have filamentous virions. There is therefore a convincing case for a common ancestor for all members of the Tymovirales that excludes all other viruses so far characterized.-Virion properties-Morphology--Virions within the families Alphaflexiviridae, Betaflexiviridae and Gammaflexiviridae are flexuous filaments, usually 12���13 nm in diameter and from about 470 to 1000 nm in length, depending on the genus. They have helical symmetry and in some genera there is clearly visible cross-banding. Members of the family Tymoviridae have isometric virions about 30 nm in diameter with a rounded contour and prominent surface structure.-Physicochemical and physical properties--These vary, depending on the particle morphology. Those with filamentous particles usually sediment as single bands with an S20,w of 92���176S, depending on the genus. In the family Tymoviridae, particles sediment as two centrifugal components (S20,w values of 42���55 and 109���125S).-Nucleic acid--In all members of the order, virions contain a single molecule of positive sense ssRNA between 5.9 and 9.0 kb in length. This constitutes 5���6% by weight of the virion in those with filamentous particles and 25���35% in those with isometric virions (Tymoviridae). The genomes are polyadenylated at the 3��� terminus (except in the genus Tymovirus where they usually have a tRNA-like structure at the 3��� end) and capped with m7G at the 5��� end.-Proteins--Almost all members have a single coat protein of 18���44 kDa. In a few instances (genus Lolavirus and some marafiviruses) there are two structural proteins which are different forms from the same gene. In a single case (genus Sclerodarnavirus) no structural protein is known.-Lipids--None reported.-Carbohydrates--Usually none but there are reports that the coat protein is glycosylated in Lolium latent virus (genus Lolavirus) and in some strains of potato virus X (genus Potexvirus).-Genome organization and replication--The largest protein encoded is a replication-associated polyprotein of about 150���250 kDa close to the 5��� end of the genome and which is translated directly from the genomic RNA. The protein contains a set of functional domains whose amino acid sequences and order are conserved in all viruses of the alphavirus-like superfamily of positive-strand RNA viruses. A methyltransferase type 1 domain (Mtr) is located near the N terminus and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain (RdRp) with a characteristic core motif S/TGx3Tx3NS/Tx22GDD occurs near the C terminus. An RNA helicase domain of superfamily 1 (Hel) is localized upstream from the RdRp domain. The Mtr is involved in capping the RNA, the Hel in unwinding RNA and the RdRp in RNA synthesis. Upstream from the Hel in some genera, there is a papain-like cysteine protease domain (P-Pro) that processes the replication polyprotein. Immediately upstream of the P-Pro, some members have a protease of the Ovarian Tumor (OTU) family. Finally, some members have an AlkB (alkylated DNA repair protein) motif between the Mtr and protease or helicase regions. Except in the genus Sclerodarnavirus, where the replicase is the only protein, there are 1 to 5 smaller proteins, translated in most cases from subgenomic RNAs. These include the capsid protein and one or more proteins involved in cell-to-cell movement. The exact organization of the genome is usually a characteristic of the individual genus.-Antigenic properties--These vary depending on the genus.-Biological properties--Most members of the order infect plants but a few species are from plant pathogenic fungi. Host range and transmission are often characteristic of individual genera.-Phylogenetic relationships within the order--In phylogenetic analysis of the replication protein, each genus and family forms a distinct, well-supported branch. The viruses with flexuous virions in the families Alphaflexiviridae and Gammaflexiviridae are more closely related to those with icosohedral particles in the family Tymoviridae than they are to members of the Betaflexiviridae (Figure 1).--Figure 1 Phylogenetic (distance) tree based on the amino acid sequences of the entire replication protein of members of the order Tymovirales. A single representative isolate of each sequenced species in the order was included. Genera and families (which are all monophyletic) have been collapsed into a triangle, the size of which corresponds to the variation found within the clade. Numbers on branches indicate percentage of bootstrap support out of 1000 bootstrap replications (when >60%). The scale indicates JTT (Jones-Taylor-Thornton matrix) amino acid distances. Tree produced in MEGA4.-Similarity with other taxa--In an analysis of the replication protein, the order forms a very distinct group within the alphavirus-like superfamily, with a rather distant relationship to plant virus families such as Closteroviridae, Bromoviridae and Virgaviridae.-Derivation of name--The name is derived from the genus Tymovirus (and family Tymoviridae). This was chosen because the other constituent families have names reflecting their flexuous virions (not a characteristic of all members of the order).
ICTV	Genus	Badnavirus	Genus: Badnavirus--Distinguishing features--The genera Badnavirus and Tungrovirus differ from other genera in the family Caulimoviridae in that their members have bacilliform-shaped virions. Members of the genus Badnavirus can be distinguished from members of the species Rice tungro bacilliform virus, the sole member of the genus Tungrovirus, by genome organization, the lack of any RNA splicing during replication, the lack of dependency on a helper virus for vector transmission, and phylogenetic placement in reverse transcriptase domain-based trees.--Nucleic acid--Virions contain a single molecule of non-covalently closed circular dsDNA of 7.2–9.2 kbp. Each strand of the genome has a single discontinuity.-Proteins--Virions have two proteins, the capsid protein (CP) and the virion-associated protein (VAP). Three domains are recognized in the CP: the N-terminal intrinsically disordered (NID) domain, the capsid (CA) domain and the nucleocapsid (NC) domain (Vo et al., 2016). The NC domain contains a zinc finger knuckle at the C-terminus and a basic, intrinsically disordered region at the N-terminus. Two isoforms of the CP (CP1 and CP2) are observed, which are thought to differ in length of the NID domain either because of the presence of alternative aspartic protease (AP) cleavage sites or as a result of targeted degradation of the larger CP isoform (CP1). The immunodominant linear epitopes are located in the NID domain.--Proteins within the P3 polyprotein are cleaved through the action of the AP but enzyme substrate sites, and hence boundaries of the mature proteins, are unknown except for the N-terminus of the smaller CP isoform (CP2) of banana streak MY virus (BSMYV) and banana streak OL virus (BSOLV). The N-terminus of the CP1 isoform has not been sequenced because of chemical blocking.--The movement protein (MP) belongs to the 30K superfamily of viral movement proteins, which form tubular structures that occupy the plasmodesmata and increase the size exclusion limit for passage of macromolecules. Electron microscopic studies suggest that whole virions traffic between the cells utilizing the tubules (Cheng et al., 1998).--Genome organization and replication--The genome contains three ORFs coding for proteins denominated P1–P3 (Figure 1.Badnavirus), except for sweet potato pakakuy virus and Jujube mosaic-associated virus, where ORF3 is divided into two, with a short intergenic region. The function of protein P1 is unknown, P2 is the virion-associated protein, P3 is a polyprotein with movement protein, capsid protein, aspartic protease and RT/RNase H1 protein precursors, in that order.-- Badnavirus genome organization. The linearized map begins at the pgRNA transcription start site (black arrow, mapped or predicted ca. 32 nts downstream of TATA box; see (Pooggin et al., 1999) and references therein). The numbering begins from the first nucleotide of the Met-tRNA primer binding site (black diamond). Light grey boxes mark open reading frames (ORFs). Conserved protein domains as listed in the Pfam database (http://xfam.org) are colored: blue is the viral movement protein (VMP) (PF01107), red is the retropepsin (p epsin-like aspartic protease) (AP) (CD00303), orange is the reverse transcriptase (RT) (CD01647) and yellow is the RNase H1 (RH1) (CD06222). The conserved C-terminus of the coat protein (CP) is marked green. Note that in Commelina yellow mottle virus, an authentic start codon of ORF1 is the second in-frame AUG at position 576 (Cheng et al., 1996), consistent with position of the ribosome shunt landing site (Pooggin et al., 1999).---A single, greater-than-genome length, terminally redundant pregenomic RNA is transcribed. No subgenomic RNAs have been observed. The pregenomic RNA serves as a polycistronic mRNA for translation of the three ORFs. By analogy to rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV), translation of ORF1 is initiated by ribosome shunting and translation of ORF2 and ORF3 by leaky scanning. Consistent with a leaky scanning model of translation, the start codon of ORF1 and ORF2 are in unfavourable translation contexts and there is paucity of internal AUG codons in both ORFs. In BSMYV and banana streak VN virus (BSVNV), ORF1 begins with a nonconventional start codon (CUG) (Geering et al., 2005, Lheureux et al., 2007). Furthermore, ORF3 is in a −1 translational frame relative to ORF2, which in turn is in a −1 translational frame relative to ORF1. The termination codon of ORF1 overlaps with the start codon of ORF2 (ATGA), and similarly for the termination codon of ORF2 and the start codon of ORF3.--Sites where the ORF3 polyprotein is cleaved by the viral aspartic protease have not been determined.--Transmission is in a semi-persistent manner by mealybugs and, for some members, by aphids or lace bugs. The virus does not multiply in its mealybug vector and there is no transovarial transmission. All motile life stages of vectors can acquire and transmit the virus. There is little information on the possible transmission of badnaviruses by other vector types. Seed transmission at a rate of 30–63% has been recorded for Kalanchoe top-spotting virus (KTSV). KTSV, cacao swollen shoot virus and an unidentified badnavirus from sugarcane have been mechanically transmitted but attempts with other viruses have been unsuccessful, which may relate to the presence of inhibitory substances in the plant sap or low virus titers. Some badnaviruses infecting woody hosts have been transmitted by dodder and grafting. Biological host ranges are narrow and restricted to one or two plant families.--Replication-competent endogenous badnaviral forms belonging to the species Banana streak OL virus, Banana streak GF virus and Banana streak IM virus are present in the genome of the wild type banana species Musa balbisiana (Chabannes et al., 2013). These endogenous elements are responsible for causing infection in M. acuminata × M. balbisiana hybrids, especially following plant propagation by tissue culture. Many other plant species contain endogenous badnaviral elements, but most are probably replication-defective (Teycheney and Geering 2011).-Antigenicity--Serological relationships between members of different species are highly variable ranging from moderate to strong.--Derivation of names--Badnadvirus: derived from bacilliform DNA virus.-Species demarcation criteria--The criteria demarcating species in the genus are:----Host ranges---Differences in polymerase (RT + RNAse H) nt sequences of more than 20%---Vector specificities

ICTV	Family	Nudiviridae	Summary-Members of the family Nudiviridae are large dsDNA viruses with distinctive rod-shaped nucleocapsids and circular genomes of 96 to 232 kbp. Nudiviruses have been identified from a diverse range of insects and crustaceans. Although nudiviruses resemble baculoviruses and these families share a number of core genes, they are part of a separate, distinct lineage of the order Lefavirales.-Characteristics of members of the family Nudiviridae-Characteristic-Description-Example-Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus Ma07 (EU747721), species Alphanudivirus oryrhinocerotis, genus Alphanudivirus-Virion-Enveloped, rod-shaped or ellipsoidal, compact (approximately 100 nm × 200 nm) or elongated (approximately 81 nm × 415 nm)-Genome-A single covalently-closed circular dsDNA molecule of 96–232 kbp encoding 89–155 proteins-Replication-Nuclear, with nucleocapsids assembled and enveloped within the nucleus-Translation-From mRNAs transcribed from viral DNA-Host range-Immature and adult stages of insects and crustaceans-Taxonomy-Class Naldaviricetes, order Lefavirales. The family has four genera with thirteen species.-Nucleic acid-Nudivirus DNA consists of a supercoiled, circular double-stranded molecule (Huang et al., 1982) and genomes of 96 to 232 kbp have been described.-Proteins-Annotations of nudivirus genomes indicate that nudiviruses encode an estimated 89 to 155 proteins. Protein gels of purified virions have distinguished 26–28 structural proteins (Burand et al., 1983, Crawford and Sheehan 1985), and proteomic analysis determined that the occlusion bodies of a nudivirus from the crane fly, Tipula oleracea, consist of 48–52 virus-encoded proteins (Bézier et al., 2017). Despite earlier claims, the gene(s) encoding occlusion body matrix protein(s) of nudiviruses have not been identified (Wang et al., 2011, Bézier et al., 2015). The nudivirus occlusion body matrix most likely consists of a protein unrelated to baculovirus polyhedrin (Chaivisuthangkura et al., 2008). Baculovirus homologs of several nudivirus genes encode structural components of baculovirus virions, such as the major capsid protein VP39 and the envelope protein P74 and other per os infectivity factors. Genes for viral replication, such as DNA polymerase, and RNA polymerase components LEF-8, LEF-9, and P47 are also conserved between these two virus families.-Genome organization and replication-ORFs are distributed throughout the genome, with approximately equal numbers of the ORFs occurring in either orientation (Figure 1.Nudiviridae) (Cheng et al., 2002, Wang et al., 2007b, Wang et al., 2011, Burand et al., 2012, Yang et al., 2014, Bézier et al., 2015, Hill and Unckless 2018, Holt et al., 2019). The order of homologs shared among nudivirus genomes is poorly conserved. Twenty-eight core genes have been identified as being present in all nudivirus genomes, including twenty-one homologs of baculovirus core genes (Table 2.Nudiviridae) (Bézier et al., 2015). In addition, intergenic regions of direct or tandem repeated sequences are present. TATA box and promoter motifs, including the baculovirus late promoter motif TAAG, have been identified upstream of a number of nudivirus ORFs, (Cheng et al., 2002, Wang et al., 2007c, Bézier et al., 2015).-Biology-Nudiviruses have been isolated from insects of the orders Coleoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, and Orthoptera, and from crustaceans of the orders Amphipoda and Decapoda, although some of these viruses are unclassified. Infections of both adult and immature stages of the host can occur. Transmission occurs horizontally and is initiated by oral ingestion of virions followed by infection of the midgut (Zelazny 1976, Huger 1985, Hamm et al., 1996, Raina and Lupiani 2006, Bézier et al., 2015). In addition, horizontal transmission occurring via sexual contact between adults has been documented for some nudiviruses, as has vertical transmission from infected adults to progeny (Hamm et al., 1996, Burand et al., 2004). Viral DNA by itself can initiate an infection when transfected into cultured cells (McIntosh et al., 2007). The outcome of infection ranges from cell lysis and ultimate mortality of the infected host to establishment of a persistent, asymptomatic infection.-Genus demarcation criteria-Because relatively low numbers of nudiviruses have been identified and studied, criteria for the demarcation of nudivirus genera are not well-defined. Currently, nudivirus genera can be broadly distinguished by molecular phylogeny based on core genes and differences in genome characteristics (size, GC and gene content), and virion dimensions, host species, tissue tropism and mode of transmission. Analyses that include sequences of unclassified nudiviruses suggest the possibility that pairwise amino acid distances of selected core genes and the presence or absence of core gene synteny may be used in the future to develop demarcation criteria for nudivirus genera with more precision. Similar analyses have led to the discrimination of four, instead of the original two, genera of nudiviruses.-Relationships within the family-Nudiviruses in the genera Alphanudivirus, Betanudivirus, Gammanudivirus and Deltanudivirus form distinct phylogenetic groupings, based upon analysis of core gene amino acid sequences (Figure 2.Nudiviridae).-Relationships with other taxa-Historically, nudiviruses have been classified within the family Baculoviridae as “non-occluded baculoviruses” but were removed from Baculoviridae upon the publication of the 6th Report in 1995 due to differences in virion morphology and the lack of occlusion bodies. Phylogenetic analysis based on the core genes shared with baculoviruses further demonstrated  that nudiviruses comprise a monophyletic group distinguishable from baculoviruses (Wang et al., 2007). Therefore, these viruses were classified together into the family Nudiviridae, were grouped together into a family with two genera in 2013, expanded in 2021 to the current four genera. Nevertheless, nudiviruses share structural, genetic and biological characters with viruses of the family Baculoviridae. Nudiviruses share 21 core genes with baculoviruses (Wang et al., 2011). Nudiviruses are the closest evolutionary relatives of baculoviruses and there is evidence that these two families separated in the Paleozoic era (Thézé et al., 2011, Petersen et al., 2022). Nudiviruses are also related to viruses in the family Hytrosaviridae. These three virus families together form the order Lefavirales within the virus class Naldaviricetes that harbours all DNA viruses characterised by the presence of pif genes, encoding per os infectivity factors.-In addition, members of the genus Bracoviriform in the family Polydnaviriformidae derive from a mesozoic nudivirus that integrated into the genome of a parasitoid wasp (Herniou et al., 2013). In several other insect species, endogenised genomes of unclassified nudiviruses have been discovered, that appear to have integrated more recently. An example is the Nilaparvata lugens endogenous nudivirus in the brown planthopper that retained all twenty-eight nudivirus core genes displayed in Table 2.Nudiviridae (Cheng et al., 2014).
ICTV	Family	Phycodnaviridae	Family: Phycodnaviridae-Nucleic acid-Virions contain large dsDNA genomes, ranging from 100 to 560 kbp. The G+C content of the viral genomes range from 40 to 52%. The genomic DNA in many of the viruses contains methylated bases, both 5-methylcytosine (m5C) and N6-methyladenine (m6A). The percent of methylated bases in the chloroviruses ranges from no m6A and 0.1% m5C to 37% m6A and 47% m5C.-Proteins-Purified virions contain as many as 100 or more proteins ranging in size from <10 to >200 kDa. The chlorovirus PBCV-1 has three glycoproteins, three myristylated proteins [the major capsid protein, Vp54, is both glycosylated and myristylated] and several phosphoproteins. The Vp54 protein consists of two eight-stranded, antiparallel-beta-barrel, “jelly-roll” domains related by a pseudo six-fold rotation. At least four proteins, including Vp54, are located on the surface of PBCV-1. Proteomic analysis determined that the virion of EhV-86 is composed of at least 28 virus encoded proteins, 23 of which are predicted to be membrane proteins. Besides the major capsid protein, putative function can be assigned to four other components of the virion: two lectin proteins, a thioredoxin and a serine/threonine protein kinase.-Genome organization and replication-By definition, all phycodnaviruses have large dsDNA genomes. These genomes range in size from 100 kb to over 550 kb with G+C contents ranging from 40 to 52%. Complete genome sequences are available for members in three genera: six chloroviruses, PBCV-1, PBCV-NY2A, PBCV-AR158, PBCV-MT325, PBCV-FR483 and Acanthocystis turfacea chlorella virus 1, two phaeoviruses Ectocarpus siliculosus virus 1 (EsV-1), Feldmannia irregularis virus and the coccolithovirus Emiliania huxleyi virus EhV-86. Partial sequence (approximately 80%) is available for a second coccolithovirus, EhV-163. Additional phycodnavirus genomes are being sequenced, but are not yet publicly available.-There is considerable variation in genome structure among the phycodnaviruses. The PBCV-1 genome is a linear 330 kb, nonpermuted dsDNA molecule with covalently closed hairpin termini (Figure 2, top). The termini consist of 35 nucleotide-long covalently closed hairpin loops that exist in one of two forms; the two forms are complementary when the 35-nucleotide sequences are inverted (flip-flop). Identical 2221-bp inverted repeats are adjacent to each hairpin end. The remainder of the PBCV-1 genome contains primarily single-copy DNA. EsV-1 has a linear dsDNA genome with almost perfect inverted repeats at each end allowing for circularization of the genome (Figure 2, bottom). It is proposed that the inverted repeats anneal with each other to form a cruciform structure that effectively circularizes the genome.-EhV-86 was originally proposed to have a linear genome. However, PCR amplification over the termini revealed a random A/T single nucleotide overhang (50% A, 50% T) suggesting the virus genome has both linear and circular phases. The detection of a DNA ligase and four endonucleases in EhV-86 hints that a linear genome may be packaged in the virions that circularizes during DNA replication.-Repetitive DNA occurs in the PBCV-1, EsV-1 and EhV-86 genomes. Both EsV-1 and PBCV-1 contain about 2 kb inverted repeats adjacent to the terminal ends. In addition to the terminal repeats, tandem repeats are located throughout the EsV-1 genome and comprise approximately 12% of the total genome size. A similar proportion of the Feldmannia sp. virus (FsV) genome also consists of repetitive DNA. EhV-86 has three repeat families (none of which is located at the ends of the genome); one family is postulated to act as an origin of replication (adding credence to the circular mode of replication model), another family is postulated to contain immediate early promoter elements and the last family has a large repetitive proline-rich domain. The repetitive regions in these genomes, while hindering sequencing projects, may play a role in recombination between viruses that allows genetic information to be exchanged with themselves and with their hosts.-Biological properties-The phycodnaviruses, depending on whether they infect freshwater algae or marine algae, are ubiquitous in freshwater or seawater collected throughout the world. Some viruses are host-specific and only infect single isolates or species of algae. For example, chloroviruses only attach to cell walls of certain unicellular, eukaryotic, chlorella-like green algae. Virus attachment is followed by dissolution of the host wall at the point of attachment and entry of the viral DNA and associated proteins into the cell, leaving an empty capsid on the host surface. Beginning about 4 h post infection (p.i.), progeny virions are assembled in the cytoplasm of the host. Infectious virions can be detected inside the cell about 30–40 min prior to virus release; virus release occurs by cell lysis. Coccolithoviruses, prymnesioviruses and raphidoviruses have wider host ranges, where individual viruses can infect a range of host isolates within specific algal species; however they do not cross the species barrier.-The phaeoviruses infect the wall-less spore or gamete stage of filamentous brown algae, followed by fusion of adjacent host and particle surfaces. Empty particles remain on the cell surface following the release of core contents. An eclipse period of approximately 3 h follows the attachment stage. The virus growth cycle is complete after approximately 14 h. During the replication cycle, particles appear in the cytoplasm and are associated with the production of cytoplasmic fibrils (ca. 5–8 nm in diameter) and clusters of membrane-bound vesicles that are absent in healthy cells. Particles are released into the medium via localized ruptures in the cell membrane; ruptures often appear at several locations on the same cell.-Coccolithoviruses attach to exposed membranes of their host and the viruses enter into the host intact via either an endocytotic or an envelope fusion mechanism, after which they rapidly disassemble (Figure 3).-Less is known about the replication of prymnesioviruses and raphidoviruses. Virus formation is observed in the cytoplasm and the nucleus remains intact and separate from the viroplasm that consists of a fibrillar matrix. Ultimately, viral production results in the disruption of organelles, lysis of the cell and release of the virus particles.-The hosts for some of the chloroviruses and coccolithoviruses can easily be grown in the laboratory and the viruses can be plaque-assayed. The hosts for some of the other viruses are either cultured axenically (e.g., prymnesiovirus hosts, P. globosa) or non-axenically in uni-alga cultures (e.g. hosts for the prasinoviruses and raphidoviruses). The brown algal viruses, which only appear in mature gametangia or sporangia cells of their hosts, can also be grown in the laboratory.-The chloroviruses, coccolithoviruses, prasinoviruses, prymnesioviruses and raphidoviruses are transmitted horizontally. The phaeoviruses are transmitted both horizontally and vertically.
ICTV	Family	Alphaflexiviridae	Family: Alphaflexiviridae-Chapter Version: ICTV Ninth Report; 2009 Taxonomy Release-Distinguishing features-The family contains viruses with flexuous filamentous virions that infect plants and a few viruses discovered in plant-infecting fungi. They share a distinct lineage of alphavirus-like replication proteins that is unusual in lacking any recognized protease domain.-Nucleic acid-Virions contain a single molecule of linear ssRNA of about 5.9–9.0 kb which is 5–6% by weight of the virion. The RNA is capped (or probably capped) at the 5′ terminus with m7G and has a polyadenylated tract at the 3′ terminus. Smaller 3′-co-terminal sgRNAs are encapsidated in some, but not all, members of the genus Potexvirus.-Proteins-The viral capsid of all members of the family (except in the genus Lolavirus) is composed of a single polypeptide ranging in size from 18 to 43 kDa. In allexiviruses, a 42 kDa polypeptide was also detected as a minor component of virions. In lolaviruses a shorter (ca. 28 kDa) carboxy co-terminal polypeptide forms an equimolar fraction of the virion with the polypeptide originating from the first AUG (ca. 32 kDa).-Genome organization and replication-There are five or six genes depending upon the genus (except in the genus Sclerodarnavirus). The ORF1-encoded product, which follows a short 5’-UTR sequence, has homologies with polymerase proteins of the “alphavirus-like” supergroup of RNA viruses. This protein (150–195 kDa) contains conserved methyltransferase, helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) motifs; some also include an AlkB domain (alkylated DNA repair protein). In all plant-infecting members, ORFs 2–4 encode the “triple gene block” (TGB) proteins involved in cell-to-cell movement and ORF5 is the viral coat protein. In some genera (Allexivirus, Lolavirus and Mandarivirus) a final ORF encodes a protein with a zinc binding finger motif and the ability to bind nucleic acids. ORFs downstream of the polymerase are translated from 3’-terminal sgRNAs that can often be found in infected tissue. Replication is (or is presumed to be) cytoplasmic and the product of ORF1 is the only virus-encoded protein known to be involved.-Biological properties-Members have been reported from a wide range of mono- and dicotyledonous plant species but the host range of individual members is usually limited. Many of the viruses have relatively mild effects on their host. All species can be transmitted by mechanical inoculation, often readily. Many of the viruses have no known invertebrate or fungus vectors; however, allexiviruses are thought to be mite-borne. Aggregates of virus particles accumulate in the cytoplasm but there are usually no specific cytopathic structures.-Species and genus demarcation criteria in the family-Genera are distinguished by various features of genome organization and host. These are summar-ized in Table 1. Throughout the family, isolates of different species should have less than about 72% nt identity (or 80% aa identity) between their respective CP or polymerase genes. Viruses from different genera usually have less than about 45% nt identity in these genes.
ICTV	Family	Tymoviridae	Family: Tymoviridae-Chapter Version: ICTV Ninth Report; 2009 Taxonomy Release-Nucleic acid-Virions contain a single molecule of positive sense, ssRNA constituting 25–35% of the particle weight. The RNA has a very high cytidine content (from 32 to about 50%) and ranges from 6.0 to 7.5 kb in length. Tymovirus genomes are capped at the 5′ terminus with m7G and most, though not all, have a tRNA-like structure at the 3′ end, which for turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) and several other members, accepts valine. The genomes of marafiviruses, maculaviruses and of the unassigned Poinsettia mosaic virus (PnMV) are polyadenylated at the 3′ terminus and are thought to be capped at the 5′ end with m7G.-Proteins-The CP of virus particles consists of either a single protein species with molecular mass of 20 kDa (tymoviruses), 24.5–25 kDa (maculaviruses), or a major protein of about 21 kDa and a minor protein of 22.5–25 kDa (marafiviruses). The capsids of PnMV and a strain of Bermuda grass etched line virus are made up of a single protein of about 21 kDa.-Genome organization and replication-The genomes of tymoviruses contain two extensively overlapping ORFs that begin 7 nt apart, and a third ORF (for CP) that is expressed from a 3′-coterminal subgenomic RNA (sgRNA). The longest ORF encodes a replication polyprotein of about 220 kDa that contains recognized domains for a methyltransferase (Mtr), a papain-like cysteine protease (P-Pro), an RNA helicase (Hel) and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The genomes of the marafiviruses, maculaviruses and PnMV possess a similar polyprotein ORF, and a CP ORF in the same reading frame that is either fused to the long ORF (marafiviruses and PnMV) or separated from it by two adjacent stop codons (grapevine fleck virus, GFkV). MRFV is the sole marafivirus with an extensive ORF near the 5′ end of the genome that entirely overlaps the replication protein ORF (see Figure 3 below). The genome of GFkV possesses two additional ORFs towards the 3′ end. Viral RNA of tymoviruses replicates in the cytoplasm in association with the double-membraned invaginations that line the periphery of the chloroplasts. Comparable vesicles occurring at the peripheries of mitochondria or chloroplasts of cells infected with maculaviruses and PnMV may have the same function. Genome expression of the tymoviruses includes post-translational autocatalytic cleavage of the replication polyprotein by the P-Pro, and synthesis and translation of a 3′-coterminal sgRNA for CP expression.-Biological properties-Host range-Members of this family infect dicotyledonous plants, with the exception of some marafiviruses that primarily infect plants in the Gramineae. Natural and experimental host ranges of individual virus species are narrow, sometimes restricted to a single type of host (e.g., GFkV infects only Vitis; MRFV only Zea). Disease symptoms are bright yellow mosaic or mottling (tymoviruses and PnMV), chlorotic stripes, vein clearing, etched lines or dwarfing (marafiviruses), and flecking of the leaves (maculaviruses).-Transmission-Tymoviruses and PnMV, but not other members of the family, are readily transmissible by mechanical inoculation. They replicate to high titres and invade all main tissues of the host. Marafi- and maculaviruses are phloem-limited. Some marafiviruses (MRFV, oat blue dwarf virus (OBDV) and Bermuda grass etched-line virus (BELV)) are distinguished by being vectored in a persistent manner by leafhoppers, in which they replicate. Some tymoviruses are weakly seed-transmissible, and are also spread by beetles, which serve as low-efficiency local vectors. Maculaviruses do not have recognized vectors, and the grapevine-associated marafi- and maculaviruses are disseminated primarily through infected propagating material.-Geographical distribution-Members of the family have been recorded from most parts of the world. Geographical distribution of individual species varies from restricted to widespread.-Genus demarcation criteria in the family-The criteria demarcating genera in the family are:-    Biological criteria: Tymoviruses are mechanically transmissible, invade parenchyma tissues, and infect dicotyledonous plants. Marafiviruses and maculaviruses are both phloem-limited and are not mechanically transmissible.-    Molecular criteria: Tymovirus genomes have three ORFs and usually a tRNA-like structure at the 3′ terminus. Maculavirus genomes have four ORFs, a 3′-terminal poly(A) tail. Marafivirus genomes have a single large ORF (two ORFs in the case of MRFV) and a 3′-terminal poly(A) tail. Tymovirus genomes possess a conserved sequence that serves as a sgRNA promoter known as the “tymobox”. The genomes from marafiviruses and PnMV contain a variant termed the “marafibox”, while no such sequence is evident in maculavirus genomes.
ICTV	Family	Parvoviridae	"Family: Parvoviridae -Summary-Members of family Parvoviridae are small, resilient, non-enveloped viruses with linear, single-stranded DNA genomes of 4–6 kb (Table 1. Parvoviridae). Viruses in two subfamilies, the Parvovirinae and Densovirinae, are distinguished primarily by their respective ability to infect vertebrates (including humans) versus invertebrates. Being genetically limited, most parvoviruses require actively dividing host cells and are host and/or tissue specific. Some cause diseases, which range from sub-clinical to lethal. A few require co-infection with helper viruses from other families. -Table 1. Parvoviridae.  Characteristics of members of the family Parvoviridae. -Characteristic-Description-Typical member-human parvovirus B19-J35 (AY386330), species Erythroparvovirus primate1, subfamily Parvovirinae-Virion-Small, non-enveloped, T=1 icosahedra, 23–28 nm in diameter-Genome-Linear, single stranded DNA of 4–6 kb with short terminal hairpins-Replication-Rolling hairpin replication, a linear adaptation of rolling circle replication.

Densovirinae: invertebrates, currently insects, crustacea, echinoderms-Taxonomy-Realm Monodnaviria, kingdom Shotokuvirae, phylum Cossaviricota, class Quintoviricetes, order Piccovirales: 3 subfamilies, Parvovirinae, Hamaparvovirinae and Densovirinae; 28 genera, 243 species.-Nucleic acid-The genome is a linear non-permuted ssDNA molecule of 4 to 6 kb in which a long coding region is bracketed by short (116 to ~550 nucleotide) imperfect palindromes that fold into dynamic hairpin telomeres (Figure 3. Parvoviridae). These hairpin sequences provide most of the cis-acting information required for DNA replication and packaging, and give rise to viral replication origins at the right- and left-ends of the genome when amplified through duplex replicative form (RF) DNA intermediates. Some parvoviruses preferentially excise and encapsidate ssDNA of negative polarity (e.g. MVM, genus Protoparvovirus), while others encapsidate strands of either polarity in equivalent (e.g. adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2), genus Dependoparvovirus) or different proportions (e.g. bovine parvovirus 1 (BPV1), genus Bocaparvovirus). These strand preferences largely reflect the efficiency with which single-strands of each sense are displaced from RF DNA during replication, which in turn reflects the relative efficiency of the viral origins associated with the two genomic termini (Cotmore and Tattersall 2005b). -Genome organization and replication -Viruses have 2 major gene cassettes; a non-structural replication initiator gene (NS) located in the 3′ (by convention the ""left"") half of the negative-sense strand, and a single capsid sequence (VP) located in the right half. (Figure 3. Parvoviridae). The replication initiator protein (NS1, sometimes called the replicase) has an endonuclease domain that combines sequence-specific duplex DNA-binding and site-specific single-strand nicking activity, followed by a superfamily 3 DNA helicase domain, but it does not have polymerase activity, and these viruses rely entirely upon host DNA polymerase(s) to amplify their genomes during productive infection. Most genomes also encode a small number of ancillary proteins in alternate and/or overlapping open reading frames, thus maximally exploiting the available DNA. These ancillary proteins are commonly genus specific and play many different roles in various aspects of the viral life cycle, although only the unique NP1 proteins encoded by members of genus Bocaparvovirus are known to influence RNA processing events by suppressing internal polyadenylation and splicing of an upstream intron. Expression strategies vary substantially between, and sometimes even within, genera, as indicated in Figure 3. Parvoviridae and in the genus sections of this report, but most vertebrate parvoviruses encode NS and VP proteins in tandem on a single DNA strand.  However, some densoviruses are ""ambisense"", meaning that transcription of the NS and VP genes proceeds from promoters at the ends of each complementary strand (Figure 3. Parvoviridae). Viruses in some genera use a single transcriptional promoter near the end of their coding sequences, and the regulation of protein expression is post-transcriptional, whereas in other genera, viruses use two or three promoters, on the same or different template DNAs, as detailed in the genus sections of this report, with NS1 commonly taking on the additional function of phasing/modulating promoter activity. When proteins are encoded in multiple co-linear frames, alternative splicing, suboptimal translational initiation or leaky scanning mechanisms are used to create different forms of the gene products. Messenger RNAs are capped and polyadenylated. Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) also expresses BocaSR, a small non-coding RNA polymerase-III transcript that resembles primate adenovirus ”virus associated” VA1 RNA in both nucleotide sequence and secondary structure. This RNA regulates expression of some NS proteins and is essential for viral DNA replication.-Subfamily demarcation criteria-The two subfamilies, Parvovirinae and Densovirinae, are distinguished primarily by their ability to infect vertebrate versus invertebrate hosts, respectively; a distinction that is generally supported by Bayesian phylogeny of the NS1 protein sequence (Figure 5.Parvoviridae).-In order to be considered for classification in either subfamily, a candidate virus must be judged to represent an authentic parvovirus by meeting certain criteria. Specifically, it must have been isolated and its DNA sequenced or, failing that, it must have been sequenced in tissues, secretions, or excretions of unambiguous host origin, supported by evidence of its distribution in multiple individual hosts in a pattern that is compatible with dissemination by infection. The sequence must be in a single contig, include all nonstructural (NS) and capsid virus protein (VP) coding regions, and reflect the size constraints, motif patterns, and structures typical of the family. This definition does not absolutely require the isolation of a viable virus provided an infectious etiology is supported by the structure and arrangement of the genome, serology, or other biological data. It is designed to allow the inclusion of viruses identified by virus discovery approaches, which typically lack reliable sequences for the telomeric hairpins, while avoiding viral sequence fragments integrated into host genomes or metagenomic data that lack clear host attribution."
ICTV	Family	Iflaviridae	Family: Iflaviridae - The citation for this ICTV Report chapter is the summary published as Valles et al., (2017):-ICTV Virus Taxonomy Profile: Iflaviridae, Journal of General Virology, 98, 527–528.-Summary-Iflaviridae is a family of small non-enveloped viruses with RNA genomes of approximately 9–11 kilobases in length encoding a single polyprotein. All members infect arthropod hosts with the majority infecting insects. Beneficial and pest insects serve as hosts and infections can be symptomless (Nilaparvata lugens honeydew virus 1), cause developmental abnormalities (deformed wing virus, sacbrood virus), behavioral changes (deformed wing virus, slow bee paralysis virus) and premature mortality (deformed wing virus, slow bee paralysis virus, infectious flacherie virus, sacbrood virus) -Characteristics of members of the family Iflaviridae.-Characteristic-Description-Example-infectious flacherie virus (AB000906), species Iflavirus flacherie-Virion-Non-enveloped, 22–30 nm diameter virions-Genome-9–11 kb of positive-sense, non-segmented RNA-Replication-Cytoplasmic within viral replication complexes formed from a variety of host cellular membranes -Translation-Directly from genomic RNA containing an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-Host Range-Arthropoda-Taxonomy-Realm Riboviria, kingdom Orthornavirae, phylum Pisuviricota, class Pisoniviricetes, order Picornavirales; 16 species in the single genus Iflavirus.-Nucleic acid-Virions contain one molecule of linear, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA approximately 9–11 kilobases in length containing a single large open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polyprotein of approximately 3,000 amino acids. A genome-linked virus protein, VPg, is covalently attached to the 5′-end of the genomic RNA and the 3′-terminus is polyadenylated. The non-coding regions (NCRs) flanking both ends of the ORF vary in size according to species.-Proteins-All proteins arise by proteolytic cleavage of the single polyprotein. Mature virions contain three major structural proteins (VP1, VP2 and VP3) generally between 28 and 44 kDa. The structural proteins are present in the N-terminal region of the polyprotein (Figure 2.Iflaviridae). A fourth smaller capsid protein (VP4) of around 4–12 kDa has been reported in some species and is located in the second position of the capsid precursor coding region. Minor quantities of the uncleaved precursors have been reported for some species.  Non-structural proteins involved in replication and polyprotein processing are present in the C-terminal region of the polyprotein.  The non-structural proteins include an RNA helicase (Gorbalenya et al., 1988), a 3C-like cysteine protease (Ye et al., 2012), and an RNA-directed RNA polymerase (Koonin and Dolja 1993), which are found in this order (Figure 2.Iflaviridae).  Each of the non-structural proteins exhibits conserved, defining domains.-Genome organization and replication-Iflaviruses possess single-stranded, positive-sense, non-segmented RNA genomes with a single ORF. The ORF is translated directly into a polyprotein that is subsequently processed to yield structural/capsid (N-terminal region) and non-structural (C-terminal region) proteins. Replication occurs in the host cell cytoplasm. The capsid proteins, arranged in the order of VP2-VP4-VP3-VP1, are often preceded by a short leader protein (L) of unknown function that is removed from VP2 before capsid assembly. VP4 is analogous to VP4 present in some dicistroviruses and in the case of infectious flacherie virus (IFV) is present as a minor structural component of the capsid. The non-structural proteins include an RNA helicase, a 3C-like cysteine protease, and an RNA-directed RNA polymerase (Figure 2.Iflaviridae). Translation initiation has been reported to be mediated by a 5′-NCR IRES in many iflaviruses, which is likely a common mechanism in the genus (Ongus et al., 2006, Lu et al., 2007). The viral RNA is infectious and serves as both genomic and viral mRNA. Mechanisms of polyprotein processing and the effects on host cell macromolecular synthesis during infection have not been well studied for the members of this family.-Biology-All member viruses have been isolated from arthropods. The host range of most members has not been examined. However, the honeybee iflaviruses including deformed wing virus, slow bee paralysis virus and sacbrood virus have been shown to infect other Apis species, as well as several Bombus species. Deformed wing virus also infects bee-parasitic mites (Varroa and Tropilaelaps spp.). Vertical and venereal transmission has been reported in the honey bee for deformed wing virus (de Miranda and Genersch 2010). The most common route of infection among the iflaviruses is through ingestion of virus-contaminated food sources. Trophallaxis in social insects facilitates intra-colonial virus dispersal. Deformed wing virus and slow bee paralysis virus can also be vectored to honeybees by parasitic mites (Varroa and Tropilaelaps genera). In addition to the gut, gonads, fat body, muscle, brain and glandular tissues also have been shown to be a target for several iflaviruses. Once the virus gains entry to the host cell, the infection process is rapid with progeny virus being produced in hours.-Genus demarcation criteria-Sequence identity at the amino acid level between the capsid proteins of isolates and strains of a species is above 90%.-Relationships with other taxa-The family Iflaviridae is a member of the order Picornavirales. Iflaviruses share properties with other members of the order (Dicistroviridae, Marnaviridae, Picornaviridae, and Secoviridae), including three replication proteins (helicase, protease, RNA-directed RNA polymerase), non-enveloped icosahedral virions of approximately 30 nm diameter, presence of a small VPg protein at the 5′-terminus, and a polyadenylated 3′-terminus.-
